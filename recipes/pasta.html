    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>3 cups all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>3 cups semolina or 00 flour* (all-purpose flour can be substituted)</li>
            <li>6 large eggs
            </li>
            <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
            </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol> 
            <li>In the bowl of an electric mixer fitted with dough hook attachment, beat the flours, eggs, olive oil, salt and water on medium-low speed until a soft, smooth ball of dough is formed, about 5-10 minutes. If the dough is too dry, add more water as needed. The dough should feel elastic and slightly tacky to the touch.</li>
            <li>Working on a lightly floured surface, knead the dough 3-4 times until it comes together.</li>
            <li>Wrap tightly in plastic wrap and let stand at room temperature for at least one hour or in the refrigerator overnight, letting it come to room temperature prior to using.</li>
            <li>Working on a lightly floured surface, divide dough into 4 equal pieces.</li>
           </ol>
