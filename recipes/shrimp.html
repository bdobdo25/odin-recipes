    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>I know the shrimp is supposed to be the main hero and all but my goodness.

        That sauce. That pooled sauce the shrimp is swimming in. Now that is the true hero here.
        
        It’s sweet, it’s tangy, it’s buttery, it’s garlicky. It’s absolute saucy goodness. And everything you could want in a sauce.
        
        Have some crusty bread nearby because you’ll want to sop up ALL of it, leaving zero leftovers behind.
